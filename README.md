   # "Shoppy" â€“ A collaborative shopping list bot for Telegram

   Couples, flatmates or families often manage shopping lists chaotically using scattered notes, messages, or different apps. They lack a central, simple place where anyone can add items and mark them as "purchased," ensuring the list is always up-to-date for everyone. Shoppy solves this problem directly within Telegram.
